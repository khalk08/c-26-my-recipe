Recipe for Byriani:
Slice the onion and fry it in oil until it is light brown. Take out 1/4 of it and keep aside.
Add Garlic, ginger, tomatoes, prunes, salt, red chili powder, cloves, cardamoms, Black Pepper, Cumin Seeds, cinnamon, black cardamom pods and bay leaves to the remaining fried onions.
Fry this until the tomatoes are tender and the water is dry.
Then add meat, yogurt and water (if desired) and cook on medium heat until the meat is tender and the water has evaporated.
On other side boil the potatoes until they're half cooked.
Now, add green chillies, mint, coriander leaves, and the half boiled potatoes to the meat. 
Simmer for 2, 3 minutes. Your meat curry is done.
Boil the rice with salt, bay leaves, cinnamon sticks and black cardamom and drain the water off when the rice is half done.
Layer the curry with the rice in a pot in one on one layers. Sprinkle the food color, fried onions, and chopped mint leaves on top of the last layer.
Close the lid tightly making sure no steam passes out of the pot and cook on low heat until the rice is done.
